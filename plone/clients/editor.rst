editor
======

This tool is designed to facilitate recording of experimental metadata,
for annotation of images in OMERO.

OMERO.editor is an editing tool, where users can create a "template"
(for example, to describe a protocol) and then use this template to
create individual "experiment" files, which contain the experimental
metadata. A summary of the experiment can be viewed alongside annotated
images in OMERO.insight. This workflow makes it easy to reuse protocols,
and to build up a detailed description of an experiment by combining
several smaller protocols.

The OMERO.editor is part of the OMERO.insight client, but can also run
as a stand-alone application. OMERO.editor saves files as XML documents,
which makes it possible for them to be read by other software.
