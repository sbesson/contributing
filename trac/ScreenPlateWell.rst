Screen Plate Well
=================

From the `main
site <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml/screen-plate-well>`_:

    "model...designed to support high content screening. It is aimed at
    providing a flexible framework to organise the images that result
    from such a screen and provide links to the external systems that
    contain full information about the components and products used."

For a simple code example of building a screen in OMERO, see
`source:ome.git/components/model/test/ome/model/utests/ScreenPlateWellTest.java </ome/browser/ome.git/components/model/test/ome/model/utests/ScreenPlateWellTest.java>`_
or see the `OmeroExamples </ome/wiki/OmeroExamples>`_ directory at
`source:ome.git/examples/ScreenPlateWell </ome/browser/ome.git/examples/ScreenPlateWell>`_

Added via `#876 </ome/ticket/876>`_, r4173 contains OMERO-specific
extensions.
