Educational use of OMERO
------------------------

The following documents the first meeting with a lecturer in the
histology and neuroanatomy department in Dundee and his request to use
OMERO for teaching purposes.

He was originally exploring some options to have an image repository
because of the constraints with room availability for the upcoming
semester. So now with the availability of OMERO he is very keen on be
able to use OMERO starting in September.

The initial starting points for the requirements discussed were:

-  The starting amount of students who would be using the system would
   be 50-60 approximately. (This would not be all at once)
-  There would be about 75 .svs images required for the entire year to
   be stored. This could be further refined by making sets of images
   available each term.
-  The students would have to be restricted to read only access to the
   image.
-  There is a requirement for the lecturer to be able to set questions
   about the images.
-  They would like to provide the students with the ability to draw
   basic ROI's on the images.

The follow up work set from this initial meeting has been set to allow
the lecturer to continue using his own account to review OMERO. He has
been provided the links to the internal documentation/training pages to
help support him through this.
