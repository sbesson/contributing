OMERO.clients
=============

OMERO.clients use a common 'gateway' to communicate with an OMERO.server
installation and allow the user to import, display, edit, and manage
server data. The OMERO team has developed a suite of clients, but the
open source nature of the OMERO project also allows developers to create
their own, customized clients.

-  **End users and scientists** interested in using our OMERO client
   software should see the client documentation page located at `Â the
   main OME
   website <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/getting-started/client-documentation>`_.

-  **Developers** interested in writing custom OMERO clients should See
