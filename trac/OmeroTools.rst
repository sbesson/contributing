Deprecated Page

`OmeroTools </ome/wiki/OmeroTools>`_ (found under
`source:ome.git/components/tools </ome/browser/ome.git/components/tools>`_)
are build products other than the `OmeroBlitz </ome/wiki/OmeroBlitz>`_
server component, some of which are nevertheless completely necessary
for the proper functioning of the OMERO.server. The name
"`OmeroTools </ome/wiki/OmeroTools>`_\ " is largely historical and so
this page has been deprecated.

-  If you are interested in how they are built, please see
   `OmeroBuild </ome/wiki/OmeroBuild>`_
-  If you are interested in using something from
   `OmeroTools </ome/wiki/OmeroTools>`_, see
   `OmeroClients </ome/wiki/OmeroClients>`_
