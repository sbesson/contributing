OMERO shares
============

`OmeroShares </ome/wiki/OmeroShares>`_ are a new feature planned for
milestone:3.0-Beta4. Beyond the standard read/write security model,
shares allow users to gather together "shopping baskets" and share them
with other users and even external collaborators.

Shares are an extension of the `session </ome/wiki/OmeroSessions>`_
concept, meaning that like sessions shares can be used as a temporary
password which will eventually time-out. Share creators control who can
visit the share, what's contained in them, and whether or not they
should be temporarily de-activated.

Planned subfeatures

-  Conversations
