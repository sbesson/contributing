OMERO.insight is the Java client which allows you to manage, browse,
view, annotate and classify your imaging data.

You can visit the following page for more information on the development
process ` OMERO Shoola
RoadMap <http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Shoola3+Roadmap>`_

Main differences between Shoola
` http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk <http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk>`_
and OMERO.insight:

-OMERO.insight reads/writes data using an OMERO3 server. Shoola2.x uses
the released OME Perl-based server.

-OMERO.insight uses the OMERO3 Rendering Engine, a server-side image
rendering system that enables high-performance image visualization in a
client-server environment.

--------------

To use this application, you must have access to an existing and fully
functional OMERO3 server, and you must know your username, password and
URL for logging into it.

Before running the client, please read the INSTALL.txt included with
this software and follow the install procedure.

Please note that the client software requires a J2SE Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) to run (version 1.5). If you don't have one already,
you can download the J2SE JRE install bundle from:
` http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/ <http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/>`_
