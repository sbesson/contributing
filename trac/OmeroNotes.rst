These notes are the starting point for future components or APIs in the
OMERO server. Once they've received enough attention, they should be
written up on Trac `Â New

    ---

    * API
    ** do we need a "primitive" api for non-java
    *** using Class versus String (CONSTANTS?)
    *** arrays rather than Collections
    ** and what about a "bulk" api?
    ** IQuery/IUpdate
    *** review IQuery/IUpdate -- create (long return)/update no hierarchy. else merge.
    *** evaluate new Dao<T extends IObject>(IQuery)

    * Model
    ** ((EmfAsDsl)) -- Use the EclipseModelingFramework ([http://eclipse.org/emf|EMF]) for our modeling/DomainSpecificLanguage needs.
    ** __Lineage__ -- Rois, Image, ResultSet, ...
    ** Details implementations: SystemClassDetails, StandardDetails, UserDefinedDetails Currently it is unneeded, but may be useful. (1.5 would ease this with ((CovariantReturnTypes)) )
    ** Events
    *** currently an event log is produced on every ''successful'' DB change (not selects). Do we also need failure logs on exceptions, or general statistics on read operations?
    *** do we need a scope and/or context on events?
    *** hierarchical events.
    *** use <any/> type for linkng update events (all but last for perf.?)
    ** Locking -- currently we are using optimistic locking at the table/object level. We should consider use cases and future requirements for pessimistic and/or coard-grained locking.
    ** move dynamic methods and Filterable methods to IBase interface(?)
    ** UserProfiles -- The Experimenter class needs to gain an umask field for the security system. Since umask will be used quite often, it makes sense to have it as a top-level value, but one could imagine a PROFILE table linked to the EXPERIMENTER table which in turn was linked to a VARIABLE table containing environment settings. (This is analogous to the bash .profile or .bashrc files) Similarly PROFILE could link to CRON and STARTUP tables for running timed and on-startup up tasks (see Task API).

    * Server
    ** ((Omero::Rules|Rules))
    ** ScratchDB -- because of the difficult of deletion, etc. it's often been wished that there were a scratch database where temporary data could be parked. This is feasible, but the use cases are not clear.
    *** items stored should be marked group/world NON-readable.
    *** A second hibernate sessionFactory would need to be started. 
    ** Embedded EJB Container for testing -- currently we are duplicating code between the services (the logic code) and the EJBs. We could get rid of all duplication IF we had a way to automatically configure the EJBs for testing (it'd be optimal if we could do this ''without'' directly specifying them in the Spring config.)
    ** Transformation API
    *** currently used a non-cascading evict
    *** or copy in session
    *** or closure for outside of session (maintainability?)
    *** or close session (performance, other ejbs?)
    *** or ((GraphApi))
    ** Task API
    *** provide for "[final] class OmeroApplication implements Task" (if final provide OmeroTaskRunner a la main(){ t=new Task(); app = OmeroApp(t); app.run() } )
    *** interface Task { doTask( TaskContext context ); } class Example implements Task { doTask( context ) { context.error( "boom" ); } }
    *** use junit like patterns (provides some familiarity)
    **** composite
    **** gathering parameter
    **** setup/teardown template pattern
    *** relatedly, provde a AbstractTaskTest
    *** how would username and eventtype work? defaults?
    *** Dispatcher, LogCreator, JmsSource( sink )
    *** notifications
    **** ( globalListener ( taskDispatchers ( jms logCreator ) ) )
    *** specific tasks
    **** constant background validator (brings an object out, checks it, returns it)
    ** Working Set
    *** based on query perhaps
    *** is it a StatefulSession or an object in DB?
    *** based on Dataset like current use-case
    *** related to an PixelsSet?

    * Queries
    ** wrap Criteria in Hiearchy with an ome.* class ("CriteriaBuilder")

    * Dynamics
    ** use a mixture of ant-based compilation, ClassLoader magic, and Spring HotSwapping to create objects. Doesn't solve the accessor issue. See also EmfAsDsl cF. SDO
    ** meta-information: if we have Image.class and we know we're talking about annotations can we infer: Image.IMAGEANNOTATIONS, ImageAnnotation.class and for the reverse case, ImageAnnotation.IMAGE. This is (part of) what's needed to mimick Perl's accessors

    * Misc
    ** AopSkipper ( depth++ and on each invocation one keeps track. need ThreadLocal) and/or Ejb3MethodInvocationAdapter
    ** DoubleFilter from omero2. Currently broken. Ability to delegate to 2 filters and walk a similar graph. (And if they differ?)

       Retry
       RetryWithBackOff
