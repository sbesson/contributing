`Â https://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/ticket/1899 <https://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/ticket/1899>`_

Need to make the Figure scripts robust enough for Preview release. Don't
intend to add any functionality to what we had at ASCB'09. Scripts to
include in 4.2 Preview Release (based on Figure types listed at
insight:#1068)

Usage
-----

Scripts need to be uploaded before they can be called by the clients.
Full testing should will involve Insight calling the scripts from the
Insight UI, but they can also be tested using Python (see below). Use
the ``uploadScript.py`` attached below.

::

    $ python uploadscript.py --host host --username username --password password --script scriptName.py

This should return a script ID on the command line, which can be used to
test the script...

Now use the other attached scripts to test the scripts. First, edit the
script parameters in the file, to choose suitable Image-IDs etc,
channels, names for images on the server. Then call the script

::

    $ python runroiScript --host host --username username --password password --script scriptID
