Deprecated Page

This page originally specified how to setup your Java CLASSPATH for
working with the server over RMI. JBoss & RMI support was removed in
`milestone:OMERO-Beta4 </ome/milestone/OMERO-Beta4>`_ and so this page
has been deprecated. For information on getting started with one of our
SDKs, please see:

-  `OmeroJava </ome/wiki/OmeroJava>`_
-  `OmeroCpp </ome/wiki/OmeroCpp>`_
-  `OmeroPy </ome/wiki/OmeroPy>`_

For examples of writing clients see
`OmeroClients </ome/wiki/OmeroClients>`_ and for info on working with
the code base, `OmeroContributing </ome/wiki/OmeroContributing>`_.
