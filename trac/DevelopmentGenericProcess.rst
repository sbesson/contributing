Define a Process Template. This was flashed out and adjusted during the
implementation of an import functionality to OMERO.insight (see
`#3415 </ome/ticket/3415>`_)
 **Important Point:** In introducing a new workflow/functionality the
work must take into account the legacy workflow as this can influence
the way the new workflow/functionality is designed and introduced.

**Phase**

**Description**

**Cycle 0:** The kickoff meeting held in cycle 0 has to identify the
following:

-  Who are the users? i.e. Who, Where, and, Why has the request for the
   area of development come from?
-  What is the main objective for the phase of work and what is
   achievable?
-  What is our own vision/the users vision?
-  The user research and planning for the interaction with scientists
   and any others starts here.

**Cycle 1:** The first phase of development work.

The development work is focused on the high technical implementation
costs of the development work. The user research work is focused on the
preparation for the initial user tests.

*Communication*

**Cycle 2:**

The user research is focused on testing the code from Cycle 1, the
design for Cycle 3, and gathering additional material and preparation
work for Cycle 4 (if required). The development process is concerned
with the implementation the designs from the user research work gathered
in Cycle 1.

*Communication*

The communication and clarification of the tickets reported These must
be reviewed by in the user research process so the development status of
the ticket is known before starting the next session.

**Cycle 3:**

The user research tests the code from Cycle 2, conducts any necessary
design for Cycle 4 (if required), and continues gathering additional
material and preparation work for Cycle 5 (if required). The development
process is concerned with the implementation the designs from the user
research work gathered in Cycle 2.

*Communication*

**Cycle 4, 5, etc.:**

Any subsequent required cycles should reflect the process as outlined in
Cycles 2 and 3.

**Cycle of saturation:**

The length of the feedback time for the process has to be carefully
considered. When a level of satisfactory and enough information has been
gathered subsequent feedback can become to personalised.
