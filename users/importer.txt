OMERO.importer
==============

The OMERO.importer is part of the OMERO.insight client, but can also run as a stand-alone application. The OMERO.importer
allows the import of proprietary image data files from a filesystem accessed from
the user's computer to a running OMERO Server. This tool uses a
standard file browser to select the image files to an OMERO Server.

To learn more about OMERO.importer see the
:ref:`tutorial/import-images` section.

    OMERO.importer

The OMERO.importer uses Bio-Formats for translation of proprietary file
formats in preparation for upload to an OMERO Server. For a detailed list of the supported `File Formats, go to
<http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats>`_.

For hints and guidelines on importing various file formats, also check
out the :wiki:`Format Guide <ImporterHowTo>`.

There is also a command line version of the importer available since
version Beta 4.0, see :wiki:`CLI Importer page <ImporterCLI>`.
