File Formats
============




The OME file formats

A major goal of the OME project is the provision of common
specifications for light microscopy file formats. Most light microscope
data is collected using proprietary software. In general, users must
convert files between formats to access different processing or display
functionality. Migration between different formats is laborious, but
most importantly often results in loss of critical image metadata.

The OME consortium has three projects providing tools for standardised
file formats: OME-XML, OME-TIFF, and Bio-Formats. The definition,
development, and maintenance of these tools are the result of close
collaboration between all academic and commercial partners in the OME
Consortium.

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

If you are generating your own OME-XML files, we have a validator that
will check OME-XML and OME-TIFF files located at

-  `http://validator.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ <http://validator.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_

The `Bio-Formats command line
tools <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats-tools.html>`_ also include
an XML validation tool.

Companies supporting OME-XML or OME-TIFF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have received support from several companies who are writing files
using our file formats, for details see our full list of
