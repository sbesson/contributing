Provides information on OME-XML, the Open Microscopy Environment's data
model and associated file formats.

What is OME?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OME is an umbrella term that stands for "Open Microscopy Environment"
and covers:

-  The `OME file
   formats <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/file-formats>`_,
   including OME-XML and OME-TIFF, and the
   `Bio-Formats Java library <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats.html%20Bio-Formats>`_
   .
-  The `OME database
   systems <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero>`_ for
   microscopy data management and analysis comprising the original OME
   Server and the OMERO platform.
-  The `OME
   consortium <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/about/who-ome>`_, the
   group behind these efforts.

What is OME-XML? Why should I care?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OME-XML is a project to provide support for the exchange of microscope
imaging data within the field of life sciences. Its key aspects include
support for collaborative sharing of data between labs who may be using
different apparatus, and the safeguarding of crucial metadata associated
with image files that can be lost when they are moved across systems (or
in many cases never recorded at all).

The term "OME-XML" means two interrelated but distinct things:

#. A `data model <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model>`_ for
   representing microscopy metadata, for use with microscopy file
   formats, expressed as an `XML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>`_
   schema.
#. A `file format <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format>`_ for
   storing microscopy information (both pixels and metadata) using the
   OME-XML data model.

The purpose of OME-XML is to provide a rich, extensible way to save
information concerning microscopy experiments and the images acquired
therein, including:

-  Dimensional parameters defining the scope of the image pixels
   (resolution, number of focal planes, number of time points, number of
   channels, etc.).
-  The hardware configuration used to acquire the image planes
   (microscope, detectors, lenses, filters, etc.).
-  The settings used with said hardware (physical size of the image
   planes in microns, laser gain and offset, channel configuration,
   etc.).
-  The person performing the experiment.
-  Some details on the experiment itself, such as a description, what
   type of experiment (FRET, time lapse, fluorescence lifetime, etc.)
   and events occurring during the acquisition (laser ablation, stage
   motion, etc.).
-  Additional, custom information you may wish to provide about your
   experiment in a structured form (known as `structured
   annotations <StructuredAnnotations>`_).

What is OME-TIFF?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OME-TIFF is a practical, high performance interchange format that
encodes the metadata using the OME-XML data model. It is essentially
OME-XML turned "inside out," with the OME-XML inside a regular TIFF
file, allowing the pixels to be read with any TIFF-compatible program,
and the metadata to be extracted with any OME-aware application.

How can I learn more?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the level of detail you want regarding OME-XML undoubtbly depends
on how you want to use it, we have provided links to varying sorts of
information.

**If you are a microscopist**, check out the `non-technical overview of
the OME-XML and OME-TIFF
formats <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/file-formats>`_. If
you are looking for software to read files in OME-XML or OME-TIFF
format, check out the
`Bio-Formats <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats>`_ plugins for
`ImageJ <http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/>`_.

**If you are a software developer** interested in working with OME-XML,
check out the [wiki:DeveloperInfo] page, which is the main focus of this
site, and perhaps also the [wiki:OmeTiff OME-TIFF overview].
