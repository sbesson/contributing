OME-XML Format
==============




Overview of the OME-XML format

This site contains general information on the OME-XML schema and
documentation for the 2003 release. There are also examples of how this
schema is used by the perl OME server.

The LOCI Team announced a variant form of OME-XML, known as OME-TIFF in
2005. This format combines the metadata facilities of OME-XML with the
standardized storage of binary data via TIFF. The new format is ideal
for storing data for visualization and analysis. The OME-TIFF
specification shows how to read and write OME-TIFF files.

In July 2007 information about the ongoing development of the OME-XML
data model was moved to
`http://www.ome-xml.org/ <http://www.ome-xml.org/>`_ and this site can
now be used to obtain the latest developer information. Users can add
work tickets to the system detailing any changes they feel should be
made. The site also contains details of the changes made for the 2007
releases.
