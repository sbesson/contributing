Structured Annotations
======================




Structured annotations (or SAs), introduced in the `2008-09
schema </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-september-2009>`_,
are a general way to extend OME-XML with additional structured
information. They can express a variety of data types and linkages, and
serve as a replacement for the Custom Attributes and Semantic Type
Definitions functionality of prior schemas.

To illustrate their use, we have provided some simple examples:

-  `min-sa-sample-lsid.xml <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/InProgress/min-sa-sample-lsid.xml>`_
-  `min-sa-sample-mo.xml <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/InProgress/min-sa-sample-mo.xml>`_

We also have a more complex example illustrating the use of SAs to
extend the ROI model.

-  `roi-sa-sample-2009.xml <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/InProgress/roi-sa-sample-2009.xml>`_

    The structure of the roi-sa-sample-2009 file has been updated to
    make it valid under **September 2009** but the ideas and concepts as
    around the use of the annotations are out of date. Nonetheless, we
    hope it helps to illustrate the intended use of SAs.

For more information on SAs from an OMERO-centric perspective, see the
`OMERO page on structured
annotations <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/wiki/StructuredAnnotations>`_.

The structure of the SA used in the **April 2010** schema is shown below
along with all the possible attachment points in the model.
