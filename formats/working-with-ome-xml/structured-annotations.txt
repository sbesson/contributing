Structured Annotations
======================




Structured annotations (or SAs), introduced in the `2008-09
schema </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-september-2008>`_,
are a general way to extend OME-XML with additional structured
information. They can express a variety of data types and linkages, and
serve as a replacement for the Custom Attributes and Semantic Type
Definitions functionality of prior schemas.

For more information on SAs from an OMERO-centric perspective, see the
`OMERO page on structured
annotations <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/omero/wiki/StructuredAnnotations>`_.

The structure of the SA used in the schema is shown below
along with all the possible attachment points in the model.
