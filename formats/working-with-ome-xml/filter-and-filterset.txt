Filter and FilterSet
====================

The filter model changed with the April 2010 release of the OME
Schema. This page provides a description of the new structures used. The
new structures are designed to work for Fluorescence Microscopy but are
flexible enough it can also work with filter configurations for most
other forms of microscopy. If you feel it will not work in your case
than please submit a ticket and we will look into the issue.

Supported Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the schema there is support for the following objects:

-  Dichroic:: The dichroic mirror or dichromatic beamsplitter. This is
   used for the primary dichroic of the instrument. Other Dichroics in
   the excitation or emission path can be modelled with the Filter
   object.
-  Filter:: This object is used to represent any type of excitation
   filter and emission/barrier filter. It contains details of the
   transmittance of the filter. It can also be used to model a dichroic
   mirror or dichromatic beamsplitter in the excitation or emission
   path.
-  FilterSet:: A FilterSet belongs to an Instrument in an OME-XML file
   and has alongside it any Filters and Dichroics it refers to. It is
   designed to represent a collection of filters available on a certain
   instrument. It can also represent a filter cube or filter block. To
   represent the set of filters used to collect an image LightPath is a
   better choice. FilterSet may contain zero or more excitation filters,
   one dichroic and zero or more emission filters. No ordering of
   filters is implied. Filters and dichroics can be reused across
   multiple filter sets. It will be normal to have a single dichroic
   that is usable with several filter combinations.
-  FilterSetRef:: These are used to attach a specific filter set from an
   Instrument to a Channel within an Image. They allow the filter set to
   be defined once in the instrument in an OME-XML file and then used
   multiple times within the images.
-  ManufacturerSpec:: The Manufacturer spec is used by both Dichroic and
   Filter to store the Manufacturer, Model, SerialNumber and LotNumber
   of the optical element.
-  FilterWheel:: This is a value within a Filter used to record what
   holder the filter is located in. Although it is named after a wheel
   it could just as easily be a filter slider or other mechanism. These
   holders allow any of there containing filters to be automatically
   selected by the microscope control software.
-  LightPath:: The LightPath object is a child of Channel and is used to
   represent the collection of Dichroic and Filters used to create the
   Channel. FilterSet is on an Instrument granularity, LightPath on a
   Channel of an Image.

#. The source produces a beam of light.
#. A small range of wavelength are passed through the filters in the
   Excitation path.
#. The light is selectively reflected by the Dichroic mirror to
   illuminate the sample.
#. The fluorphore in the sample absorbs the light from 3 and re-emits it
   on a new wavelength. Some of this re-emitted light travels towards
   the dichroic mirror.
#. The light on the new wavelength is selectively transmitted by the
   dichroic mirror.
#. The wavelength of detected light is further narrowed and stray
   reflections reduced by the filters in the Emission path.
#. The light can be optionally split by a Dichroic in the emission path
   to go to two, or more, detectors. This Dichroic is modelled as a
   Filter of type "Dichroic"
#. The split light beam can travel directly from the Dichroic to a
   detector.
#. The beam may be further filtered before reaching a detector.

Structure of the filter data in OME-XML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The filter data elements are part part of the central OME Schema. The
filters are part of the Instrument block. Each instrument can contain
zero or more filters, dichroics, and filter sets. Each filter set used
unique IDs to referrer to the filters and dichroic it contains. If there
are any additional filters used with the Channels within an image then
those filters are also defines at the instrument level and referenced
from the channel with a LightPath element using the unique ID. The
filters and dichroics are both extensions of the ManufacturerSpec
element so store this common data. A filter also contains one
TransmittanceRange element that describes the optical characteristic of
it.

.. figure:: /images/formats/FilterSet-Top.*
   :align: center
   :alt: FilterSet Top

The FilterSet contains three kinds of references, one to a dichroic ID
called DichroicRef, and two sets to filter IDs called
ExcitationFilterRef and EmissionFilterRef. Each of the three kinds are
optional. There is no distinction on whether a filter is designed for
emission or excitation at the filter level. The distinction is made
within the filter set (or LightPath) by the assignment of the filter ID
reference to either a ExcitationFilterRef or EmissionFilterRef. Not all
the objects in a FilterSet need to be used at the same time and there is
no ordering implied within the groups of references.

The Dichroic object is simple, it simply contains its unique ID and the
values it gets from extending ManufacturerSpec. In ManufacturerSpec each
object can have a SerialNumber and/or a LotNumber. The LotNumber is more
commonly used in Filters and Dichroics so the batch of manufacture is
recorded.

The Filter object has the values it gets by extending ManufacturerSpec
and a unique ID the same as the Dichroic. In addition it has a Type and
a FilterWheel value. In addition to these extra values it contains one
TransmittanceRange object. The TransmittanceRange describes the optical
characteristic of the filter and has values for the CutIn and CutOut,
along with the CutInTolerance and CutOutTolerance, all expressed in
nanometers. There is also the Transmittance of the filter express as a
percentage fraction.

.. figure:: /images/formats/LightPath-Top.*
   :align: center
   :alt: FilterSet LightPath Top

The LightPath contains three kinds of references, one to a dichroic ID
called DichroicRef, and two sets to filter IDs called
ExcitationFilterRef and EmissionFilterRef. Each of the three kinds are
optional. There is no distinction on whether a filter is designed for
emission or excitation at the filter level. The distinction is made
within the LightPath by the assignment of the filter ID reference to
either an ExcitationFilterRef or EmissionFilterRef. The key difference
between LightPath and FilterSet is that ALL the filters in a LightPath
have been used and there order is specified.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows the structure of the resulting xml.

-  This defines six filters, five are standard filters, the sixth is a
   dichroic used as a filter.
-  It defines two Dichroics that can represent the primary Dichroic in
   an instrument.
-  The FilterSet:1 contains Filter:1 and/or Filter:2 for excitation,
   Dichroic:1 and Filter:3 and/or Filter:4 for Emission.

It contains dummy data.

Sample piece of a .ome.xml file showing the Image side - the LightPath structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows the structure of the resulting xml.

-  Channel:1 defines a LightPath that uses Filter:1 for excitation,
   Dichroic:1, then Filter:2 & Filter:6 for Emission in that order.
-  Channel:2 defines a LightPath that uses Filter:1 for excitation,
   Dichroic:1, then Filter:2 & Filter:6 & Filter:5 for Emission in that
   order.
-  Channel:3 references FilterSet:1, from this we do not know which of
   the filter in that FilterSet were used and in which order.
-  Dichroic:2 though defined above is not used by this Image.

It contains dummy data.
