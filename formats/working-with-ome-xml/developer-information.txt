Developer Information
=====================




Here your will find two types of information:

-  How we develop the OME Model with your contributions
-  How you can work with the OME Model

This will hopefully get you started and answer some initial questions
for you. We know the topic is not fully covered here and we will add
further information as time allows. We are happy to answer further
questions through the OME-Users and OME-Developers `mailing
lists </site/community/mailing-lists>`_ or `forums </community/>`_ and
receive requests for additional documentation pages.

The main discussion lists and forums are accessed from the general
site's `Community </site/community>`_ page and this is a good place to
ask questions. This also has links to our main
`Trac <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_ and you are free to create
tickets for the team with your suggestions, comments, feature requests
and bug reports. Here you will find the current release timeline, the
future development ideas and detailed tickets outlining the proposed
changes and additions to the development of OME.

Where is your source code?
--------------------------

All the OME code is stored in a central Git repository. The OME Data
Model part of this is available here:
`specification <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/browser/ome.git/components/specification>`_.

How does the process of developing OME Model work?
--------------------------------------------------

Regular meetings are held to review the model and discuss additions or
changes. Before making any changes, we come up with a proposal. This
outlines the changes required and why we think it is necessary. We then
can publish this to the OME community and provide links to the relevant
work tickets. We generally only publish major changes or breaking
changes in advance. Minor additions can usually be safely made so these
are just published on release. We regularly ask the community for
comments on what they would like added, especially when we are moving
into a new imaging area.

What are the steps in the process?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What follows is the list of key steps that changes should pass through
before they are implemented into the currently released schema:

-  Write a document that we can attach to the relevant ticket
-  Propose time frames for announcement, implementation
-  If elements have to be removed/replaced, make an announcement to the
   community
-  Generate UML diagrams
-  Generate the updated XSD files
-  Generate XSLT to transform XML files
-  Write same files
-  Write tests
-  Include into next Schema Release. It is worth noting that at present
   we are trying to keep schema changes in step with new versions of
   OMERO so they are released simultaneous. This is why the tickets for
   OME-XML development have been moved to the main `OME
   Trac <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome>`_

How can I, as a developer, work with your model?
------------------------------------------------

A good place to start is by looking at the `ModelOverview 2010-04
collection of diagrams <model-overview-2010-04>`_ we have put together
showing the structure and connection between different parts of the OME
Model.

We have pages covering parts of the model in detail:

-  `Filter And FilterSet <filter-and-filterset>`_
-  `Screen Plate Well <screen-plate-well>`_ - our HCS solution
-  `Structured Annotations <structured-annotations>`_

We also have pages covering specific use cases:

-  `SPIM Initial Support <spim-initial-support>`_ - this has been
   superseded by the general 6D,7D,8D solution
-  `6D, 7D and 8D Storage <6d-7d-and-8d-storage>`_
-  `Tiled Images <tiled-images>`_

If you are working with several versions of the OME Model, perhaps to
support the loading/saving of a variety of files, then we recommend you
look at the following pages. They show what happened with each release:

-  The **current major release** - see `Changes For June
   2011 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-june-2011>`_
-  Previous releases:

   -  `Changes For June
      2010 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-june-2010>`_
      - (major)
   -  `Changes For April
      2010 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-april-2010>`_
      - (major)
   -  `Changes For September
      2009 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-september-2009>`_
      - (major)
   -  `Changes For September
      2008 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-september-2008>`_
      - (major)
   -  `Changes For February
      2008 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-february-2008>`_
      - (major)
   -  `Changes For September
      2007 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-september-2007>`_
      - (minor)
   -  `Changes For June
      2007 </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/changes-for-june-2007>`_
      - (major)

There are some concepts used in the Model that benefit form an
explanation:

-  `LSID IDs and LSIDs in
   OME-XML </site/support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml/id-and-lsid>`_
-  `Version
   Information </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/version-information>`_

What detailed documentation do you have?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have three types of detailed information available:

What do you need to store in an OME-XML/OME-TIFF file?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These pages have information on what parts of the model we expect to see
values in to produce a file of a given quality/utility.

-  The required data for a OME Compliant file as outline in our
   published work - see `Compliant File
   Specification </site/support/file-formats/schemas/specifications/compliant-file-specification>`_
-  The required data for a OME Compliant HCS file - see `Compliant HCS
   Specification </site/support/file-formats/schemas/specifications/compliant-hcs-specification>`_
-  Bare minimum required data to read an image - see `Minimum
   Specification </site/support/file-formats/schemas/specifications/minimum-specification>`_

If you want to look at some simple examples start as the `sample files
page </site/support/file-formats/ome-tiff/ome-tiff-data>`_.

If you are writing your own files we also provide a
`validator <http://validator.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_ you can use to
check your files.

What does an individual attribute or element store?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have auto-generated documentation available for each release of the
schema. This has information on each attribute and element:

-  `June 2010 -
   current <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/Documentation/Generated/OME-2010-06/ome.html>`_
-  `April
   2010 <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/Documentation/Generated/OME-2010-04/ome.html>`_
-  `September
   2009 <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/Documentation/Generated/OME-2009-09/ome.html>`_
-  `September
   2008 <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/Documentation/Generated/OME-2008-09/ome.xsd.html>`_
-  `February
   2008 <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/Documentation/Generated/OME-2008-02/ome.xsd.html>`_
-  `June
   2007 <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/Documentation/Generated/OME-2007-07/ome.xsd.html>`_
-  `Legacy 2003
   (FC) <http://git.openmicroscopy.org/src/master/components/specification/Documentation/Generated/OME-2003/ome.xsd.html>`_

How do I get the technical schema description?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are published as `XSD
files <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/>`_ on out main website.
They are usually read by XML validators and parsers but are viewable as
text files.

    For further information feel free to ask questions on the
    `forums </community/>`_ and `mailing
    lists </site/community/mailing-lists>`_.
