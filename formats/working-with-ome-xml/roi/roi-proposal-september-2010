Information on the proposed ROI Model for the next available Major
release.

This moves the ROI model into 3-dimensions by pushing the Z value from
the Shape level down into the geometry objects themselves (e.g. Point
now has X, Y, Z).

This requires the removal of Polyline and Path. They are replaced with a
Vertex Array geometry object. It should be possible to upgrade Polyline
objects as part of the XSLT transform. It seams unlikely that Path can
be upgraded in this manner, more complex code would be required.

Polyline and Path are being marked as **Deprecated** in the April 2010
release of the schema. Details of that ROI model is available
`here <.>`_.

The diagram below shows an overview of the current proposal, it is not
set in stone and we would welcome comments and suggestions.
