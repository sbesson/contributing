OME Model, OME-XML and OME-TIFF
===============================


A major goal of the OME project is the provision of common
specifications for light microscopy file formats. Most light microscope
data is collected using proprietary software. In general, users must
convert files between formats to access different processing or display
functionality. Migration between different formats is laborious, but
most importantly often results in loss of critical image metadata.

The OME consortium has three projects providing tools for standardised
file formats: OME-XML, OME-TIFF, and Bio-Formats. The definition,
development, and maintenance of these tools are the result of close
collaboration between all academic and commercial partners in the OME
Consortium.


What is OME-TIFF?
-----------------

OME-TIFF is a practical, high performance interchange format that
encodes the metadata using the OME-XML data model. It is essentially
OME-XML turned "inside out," with the OME-XML inside a regular TIFF
file, allowing the pixels to be read with any TIFF-compatible program,
and the metadata to be extracted with any OME-aware application.

Check out the :doc:`OME-TIFF overview <ome-tiff/index>`.


OME-XML Compliance
------------------

View 
:doc:`our proposal <schemas/specifications/compliant-file>`
for a specification, to describe as completely as possible a specific
imaging experiment.

Or read our published paper 
`Linkert et al (2010), J. Cell Biol. 189(5):777-782 <http://jcb.rupress.org/content/189/5/777>`_

:doc:`Specifications for HCS <schemas/specifications/compliant-hcs>` 
and a :doc:`minimum specification <schemas/specifications/minimum>` are also 
available.

Developer Resources
-------------------

Developing software to work with OME-XML files? Find links to more
technical information on the
:doc:`Developer information page <working-with-ome-xml/index>`.

Latest OME-XML/OME-TIFF
-----------------------

Want to find the latest **June 2012 Schema** specification for OME-XML
or OME-TIFF? Check the 
`schema location <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/>`_ 
page that always has
links to the latest version and latest auto-generated documentation.

OME-XML Versions
----------------

Discover how the OME-XML and OME-TIFF 
`version system </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/version-information>`_
works.

Have a file and need to know the version? - use the 
`online validator <http://validator.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_.

How to Cite OME's Work
----------------------

If you have used OME-XML, OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats or OMERO in your work
find the :about_plone:`correct citations <licensing-attribution/citing-ome>` 
to use.

Companies supporting OME-XML or OME-TIFF
----------------------------------------

We have received support from several companies who are writing files
using our file formats, for details see our full list of
:about_plone:`Partners <partners>`.
