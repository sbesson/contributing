OME Model, OME-XML and OME-TIFF
===============================


A major goal of the OME project is the provision of common
specifications for light microscopy file formats. Most light microscope
data is collected using proprietary software. In general, users must
convert files between formats to access different processing or display
functionality. Migration between different formats is laborious, but
most importantly often results in loss of critical image metadata.

The OME consortium has three projects providing tools for standardised
file formats: OME-XML, OME-TIFF, and Bio-Formats. The definition,
development, and maintenance of these tools are the result of close
collaboration between all academic and commercial partners in the OME
Consortium.


What is OME-TIFF?
-----------------

OME-TIFF is a practical, high performance interchange format that
encodes the metadata using the OME-XML data model. It is essentially
OME-XML turned "inside out," with the OME-XML inside a regular TIFF
file, allowing the pixels to be read with any TIFF-compatible program,
and the metadata to be extracted with any OME-aware application.

OME-XML Compliance
------------------

View 
`our proposal </site/support/file-formats/schemas/specifications/compliant-file-specification>`_
for a specification, to describe as completely as possible a specific
imaging experiment.
