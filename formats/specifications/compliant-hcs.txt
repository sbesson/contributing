Compliant HCS specification
===========================


OME compliant HCS file specification. This was developed in conjunction
with the June 2010 release of the OME-XML Model and has been updated to the
June 2016 release.

A compliant specification for HCS OME files has been defined. This is
not the minimum required for the display of an image, that is the
:doc:`Minimum Specification <minimum>`. This is the
information a file should contain to be useful while
conforming to the spirit of the OME projects aims.

This sample structure is based on Sample One in the 
OME Compliant File Specification 
(see :doc:`index`):

.. literalinclude:: hcs.ome.xml

Alternative valid forms:

-  would have a ``ome:TiffData`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData`` block 
   (this would be used in the header of an OME-TIFF file)
-  would have a ``ome:MetadataOnly`` block instead of the ``bf:BinData`` 
   block (this would be used as a companion to one or more ``ome:BinaryOnly``
   OME-TIFF files)

.. note:: A units system was added in January 2015. This sample assumes the
   default unit for each value is used.
