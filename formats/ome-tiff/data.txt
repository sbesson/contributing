OME-TIFF sample data
====================

This section provides some sample data in OME-TIFF format. They include data
produced from an acquisition system as well as artificial sample datasets (i.e.
designed for developer testing that illustrate some possible data
organizations, which should be useful if you are interested in implementing
support for OME-TIFF within your software.

All the OME-TIFF sample data discussed below are available from our
:ometiff_downloads:`OME-TIFF sample images resource <>`.

Single file OME-TIFF
--------------------

This section lists various examples of single file OME-TIFF. For examples of
OME-TIFF dataset distributed across multiple TIFF files, see
:ref:`multifile_samples`.

.. _artificial-datasets:

Artificial datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All datasets in the following table were :source:`artificially
generated <components/formats-bsd/src/loci/formats/tools/MakeTestOmeTiff.java>`
with each plane labeled according to its dimensional position for easy
testing. Each one consists of a single OME-TIFF file (2015-01 schema
version) containing every constituent image plane.

.. _modulo-datasets:

Modulo datasets

Sample files implementing the :doc:`/developers/6d-7d-and-8d-storage` are available from the
:ometiff_downloads:`Modulo <modulo>` folder of the image downloads resource.

SPIM

- :ometiff_downloads:`LAMBDA-ModuloAlongZ-ModuloAlongT.ome.tiff <modulo/LAMBDA-ModuloAlongZ-ModuloAlongT.ome.tiff>` -
  excitation of 5 wavelength [Λ, big-lambda] each recorded at 10 emission
  wavelength ranges [λ, lambda].

FLIM
""""

  2 channels and 8 histogram bins each recorded at 2 'real-time' points T,
  with additional relative-time points (time relative to the
  excitation pulse) interleaved as ModuloAlongT.

- :ometiff_downloads:`FLIM-ModuloAlongC.ome.tiff <modulo/FLIM-ModuloAlongC.ome.tiff>` -
  2 real channels and 8 histogram bins each recorded at 2 timepoints, with
  additional relative-time points interleaved between channels as

.. _multifile_samples:

Multi-file OME-TIFF filesets
----------------------------

This section lists various examples of OME-TIFF datasets distributed across multiple TIFF files.

.. _tubhiswt_samples:

Sample biological dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following OME-TIFF datasets consist of tubulin histone GFP coexpressing 
*C. elegans* embryos. Many thanks to
`Josh Bembenek <http://loci.wisc.edu/people/josh-bembenek>`_ for preparing
and imaging this sample data.

The datasets were acquired on a multiphoton workstation (2.1 GHz Athlon
XP 3200+ with 1GB of RAM) using
`WiscScan <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/wiscscan>`_. All image
planes were collected at 512x512 resolution in 8-bit grayscale, with an
integration value of 2.

The files available for download have been updated to the current schema version since their initial creation.

Partial OME-XML metadata datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _binary-only-sample:

Binary only OME-TIFF fileset
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :ometiff_downloads:`binary only OME-TIFF fileset <binaryonly>` contains a
set of 18 by 24 pixel images (with black and white text on each plane giving
its time, z-depth and channel) where each of the five Z sections are saved as
a separate file.

The header of the :ometiff_downloads:`master OME-TIFF file <binaryonly/multifile-Z1.ome.tiff>` 
contains the complete OME-XML metadata while the OME-XML metadata stored into
the header of the four other files refer to this master OME-TIFF file using the
:ref:`partial OME-XML metadata <binary_only>` specification.

.. _companion-sample:

Companion OME-TIFF fileset
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :ometiff_downloads:`companion OME-TIFF fileset<companion>` contains a set 
of 18 by 24 pixel images (with black and white text on each plane giving its 
time, z-depth and channel) where each of the five Z sections are saved as a separate file and a companion file.

The :ometiff_downloads:`companion fileset<companion/multifile.companion.ome>` contains the complete OME-XML metadata
for the fileset while the five OME-TIFF files refer to this companion file 
using the :ref:`partial OME-XML metadata<binary_only>` specification.
