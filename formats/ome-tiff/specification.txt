OME-TIFF specification
======================

The following provides technical details on the OME-TIFF
format. It assumes familiarity with both the
`TIFF <http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/index.html>`_ and
:schema_plone:`OME-XML <>` formats, although there is some review of both.

An OME-TIFF dataset consists of:

- one or more files in standard TIFF format with the file extension
  ``.ome.tif`` or ``.ome.tiff`` or `BigTIFF format <http://bigtiff.org/>`_
  with one of these same file extensions or a BigTIFF-specific
  extension ``.ome.tf2``, ``.ome.tf8`` or ``.ome.btf``
- a string of OME-XML metadata embedded in the ImageDescription tag of the
  first IFD (Image File Directory) of each file.

Note that BigTIFF-specific file extensions are an addition to the original
specification, and software using an older version of the specification may
not be able to handle these file extensions.

OME-XML metadata
----------------

This string is a standard block of OME-XML, except that instead of
storing pixels as BinData elements with base64-encoded pixel data
beneath them, it references pixels with TiffData elements that specify
which TIFF IFD corresponds to each image plane. As such, the OME-XML
string can be regarded as a "metadata block" because the actual pixels
are stored within the TIFF structure, not the XML.

.. _figure-tiff-header:

.. figure:: /images/ome-tiff-header.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%
   :alt: OME-TIFF header

   OME-TIFF header


The diagram :ref:`figure-tiff-header` (adapted from the TIFF
specification) shows the organization of a TIFF header along with the
placement of the OME-XML metadata block.  Note this is for the TIFF
standard specification only; the header structure is slightly
different for BigTIFF; see the `BigTIFF file format specification
<http://bigtiff.org/#FILE_FORMAT>`__. A TIFF file can contain any
number of IFDs, with each one specifying an image plane along with
certain accompanying metadata such as pixel dimensions, physical
dimensions, bit depth, color table, etc. One of the fields an IFD can
contain is ImageDescription, which provides a place to write a comment
describing the corresponding image plane. This field is a convenient
place to store the OME-XML metadata block—any TIFF library capable of
parsing IFDs and extracting an ImageDescription comment can easily
obtain an OME-TIFF file's entire set of metadata as OME-XML.

.. note:: 
    A TIFF file contains one IFD per image plane, but the
    OME-XML metadata block is stored only in the first IFD structure.
    However, for an image sequence distributed across multiple OME-TIFF
    files, each file will contain a copy of the OME-XML metadata block
    (see :ref:`binary_only` below for exceptions to
    this rule). Thus, if any files are lost, the metadata is preserved. The
    OME-XML block in each file is nearly identical—the only difference is in
    the TiffData elements appearing beneath Pixels elements, since each TIFF
    file contains a different portion of the image data (see
    :ref:`multifile-ometiff` below).


DimensionOrder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above, the standard OME-XML format encodes image planes as
base64 character blocks contained within BinData elements beneath a
Pixels element. The Pixels element has a DimensionOrder attribute that
specifies the rasterization order of the image planes. For example,
XYZTC means that there is a series of image planes with the Z axis
varying fastest, followed by T, followed by C (e.g. if a XYZTC dataset
contains two focal planes, three time points and two channels, the order
would be: Z0-T0-C0, Z1-T0-C0, Z0-T1-C0, Z1-T1-C0, Z0-T2-C0, Z1-T2-C0,
Z0-T0-C1, Z1-T0-C1, Z0-T1-C1, Z1-T1-C1, Z0-T2-C1, Z1-T2-C1).

Since a multi-page TIFF has no limit to the number of image planes it
can contain, the same scheme described above for specifying the
rasterization order works within the OME-TIFF file. The only difference
is that instead of the pixels being encoded in base64 inside BinData
elements, they are stored within the TIFF file in the standard fashion,
one per IFD; see the :ref:`TiffData element <tiffdata>` below for specifics.

TIFF comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When embedding your OME-XML string as a TIFF comment, it is best practice to
preface it with the following informative comment:

::

    <!-- Warning: this comment is an OME-XML metadata block, which contains
    crucial dimensional parameters and other important metadata. Please edit
    cautiously (if at all), and back up the original data before doing so.
    For more information, see the OME-TIFF web site:
    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-model/ome-tiff/ -->

.. _tiffdata:

The TiffData element
--------------------

As the illustration :ref:`figure-tiff-header` shows, all that is needed to 
indicate that the pixels are located within the enclosing TIFF structure is a
:schema_plone:`TiffData <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#TiffData>`
element with no attributes. By default, the first IFD corresponds to
the first image plane (Z0-T0-C0), and the rasterization order of subsequent
IFDs is given by the Pixels element's DimensionOrder attribute, as
described above.

However, there are several attributes for TiffData elements allowing
greater control over the dimensional position of each IFD:

-  :schema_plone:`IFD <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#TiffData_IFD>`
   - gives the IFD(s) for which this element is applicable.
   Indexed from 0. Default is 0 (the first IFD).
-  :schema_plone:`FirstZ <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#TiffData_FirstZ>`
   - gives the Z position of the image plane at the specified
   IFD. Indexed from 0. Default is 0 (the first Z position).
-  :schema_plone:`FirstT <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#TiffData_FirstT>`
   - gives the T position of the image plane at the specified
   IFD. Indexed from 0. Default is 0 (the first T position).
-  :schema_plone:`FirstC <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#TiffData_FirstC>`
   - gives the C position of the image plane at the specified
   IFD. Indexed from 0. Default is 0 (the first C position).
-  :schema_plone:`PlaneCount <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#TiffData_PlaneCount>`
   - gives the number of IFDs affected. Dimension order of
   IFDs is given by the enclosing Pixels element's DimensionOrder
   attribute. Default is the number of IFDs in the TIFF file, unless an
   IFD is specified, in which case the default is 1.

Here are some example XML fragments:

Fragment 1
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    <Pixels ID="urn:lsid:loci.wisc.edu:Pixels:ows325"
            Type="uint8" DimensionOrder="XYZTC"
            SizeX="512" SizeY="512" SizeZ="3" SizeT="2" SizeC="2">
        <TiffData/>
    </Pixels>

+-------+-----------------+
| IFD   | Position        |
+=======+=================+
| 0     | Z0-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 1     | Z1-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 2     | Z2-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 3     | Z0-T1-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 4     | Z1-T1-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 5     | Z2-T1-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 6     | Z0-T0-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 7     | Z1-T0-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 8     | Z2-T0-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 9     | Z0-T1-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 10    | Z1-T1-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 11    | Z2-T1-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+

The default TiffData tag simply assigns every IFD to a position
according to the given DimensionOrder rasterization. If the TIFF file
has more than SizeZ\*SizeT\*SizeC (3\*2\*2=12 in this case) IFDs, the
remaining IFDs are extraneous and should be ignored by OME-TIFF readers.

Fragment 2
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    <Pixels ID="urn:lsid:loci.wisc.edu:Pixels:ows462"
            Type="uint8" DimensionOrder="XYCTZ"
            SizeX="512" SizeY="512" SizeZ="4" SizeT="3" SizeC="2">
        <TiffData PlaneCount="10"/>
    </Pixels>

+-------+-----------------+
| IFD   | Position        |
+=======+=================+
| 0     | Z0-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 1     | Z0-T0-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 2     | Z0-T1-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 3     | Z0-T1-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 4     | Z0-T2-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 5     | Z0-T2-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 6     | Z1-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 7     | Z1-T0-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 8     | Z1-T1-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 9     | Z1-T1-C1        |
+-------+-----------------+

When specified, the PlaneCount attribute gives the number of IFDs
affected by the TiffData element. In this case, even though the Pixels
element defines 4\*3\*2=24 image planes total, the TiffData element
assigns only 10 planes. The remaining 14 planes are unspecified and
hence lost.

Fragment 3
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    <Pixels ID="urn:lsid:loci.wisc.edu:Pixels:ows197"
            Type="uint8" DimensionOrder="XYZTC"
            SizeX="512" SizeY="512" SizeZ="4" SizeC="3" SizeT="2">
        <TiffData IFD="3" PlaneCount="5"/>
    </Pixels>

+-------+-----------------+
| IFD   | Position        |
+=======+=================+
| 3     | Z0-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 4     | Z1-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 5     | Z2-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 6     | Z3-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 7     | Z0-T1-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+

States that the rasterization begins at the fourth IFD (IFD #3), and
continues for five planes total. IFDs #0, #1 and #2 are not used, and
should be ignored by OME-TIFF readers.

Fragment 4
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    <Pixels ID="urn:lsid:loci.wisc.edu:Pixels:ows789"
            Type="uint8" DimensionOrder="XYZTC"
            SizeX="512" SizeY="512" SizeZ="1" SizeC="1" SizeT="6">
        <TiffData IFD="0" FirstT="5"/>
        <TiffData IFD="1" FirstT="4"/>
        <TiffData IFD="2" FirstT="3"/>
        <TiffData IFD="3" FirstT="2"/>
        <TiffData IFD="4" FirstT="1"/>
        <TiffData IFD="5" FirstT="0"/>
   </Pixels>

+-------+-----------------+
| IFD   | Position        |
+=======+=================+
| 0     | Z0-T5-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 1     | Z0-T4-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 2     | Z0-T3-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 3     | Z0-T2-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 4     | Z0-T1-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+
| 5     | Z0-T0-C0        |
+-------+-----------------+

Any number of TiffData elements may be provided. In this case, the dimensional 
positions of each of the first six IFDs are explicitly defined, effectively 
overriding the rasterization given by DimensionOrder, storing the planes in 
reverse temporal order.


For details on validating your OME-XML metadata block, see the
validating OME-XML section on the :doc:`tools` page.

.. _multifile-ometiff:

Multi-file OME-TIFF
-------------------

As demonstrated above, the OME-TIFF format is capable of storing the
entire multidimensional image series in one master OME-TIFF file.

Alternatively, a collection of multiple OME-TIFF files may be used. Using
the TiffData attributes outlined above together with
`UUID <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier>`_
elements and attributes, the OME-XML metadata block can unambiguously
define which dimensional positions correspond to which IFDs from which
files. Each OME-TIFF need not contain the same number of images.

The only difference between the OME-XML metadata block per TIFF file is the
:schema_plone:`UUID <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#OME_UUID>`
attribute of the root OME element. This value should be a distinct
UUID value for each file, so that each TiffData element can
unambiguously reference its relevant file using a UUID child element.

   .. note::
     The :schema_plone:`FileName <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#TiffData_TiffData_UUID_FileName>`
     attribute of the UUID is optional, but strongly recommended—otherwise,
     the OME-TIFF reader must scan OME-TIFF files in the working directory
     looking for matching UUID signatures.

When splitting an OME-TIFF across multiple files, the OME-XML metadata must
either be embedded into each TIFF file or use partial metadata blocks.

Embedded OME-XML metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first case, a nearly identical OME-XML metadata block must be inserted
into the first IFD of each constituent OME-TIFF file.

The only difference between the OME-XML metadata block per TIFF file is the
:schema_plone:`UUID <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#OME_UUID>`
attribute of the root OME element. This value should be a distinct
UUID value for each file, so that each TiffData element can
unambiguously reference its relevant file using a UUID child element.

The :ref:`tubhiswt_samples` demonstrate how OME-TIFF datasets can be
distributed across multiple files. Each of the files in the set has identical
metadata apart from the `UUID`, the unique identifier in each file. For
example the identifiers could be distributed as follows:

Partial OME-XML metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of embedding the full OME-XML metadata into the header of each

OME-TIFF files using the
:schema_plone:`Binary-Only <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#OME_BinaryOnly>`
element as illustrated below::

The :schema_plone:`MetadataFile <Documentation/Generated/OME-2015-01/ome_xsd.html#OME_OME_BinaryOnly_MetadataFile>`

should contain the UUID of this master file.

The master file containing the full OME-XML metadata should be:

- either an OME-XML companion file with the extension :file:`.companion.ome`
  (see the :ref:`companion-sample`)
- or a master OME-TIFF file containing the full metadata (see the
  :ref:`master-sample`)
