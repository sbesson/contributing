Sample image files
==================

Sample OME-XML and OME-TIFF files can be found here:
:image_downloads:`Image downloads resource <>`.

Each schema version's samples are located in a folder named after the schema's
date e.g. folder :image_downloads:`OME-TIFF/2016-06/` has samples using schema
version :schema_plone:`OME/2016-06`.

See the :doc:`/ome-tiff/data` section for more information about the sample
TIFF files. The OME-XML files contained in the :image_downloads:`OME-XML`
folder are named to reflect the aspects of the Data Model they demonstrate so
they should be self-explanatory.
