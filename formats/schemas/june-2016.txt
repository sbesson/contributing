Changes for June 2016
=====================


The list of the key changes for the June 2016 major release of the
OME-XML data model. This schema release will tie in with the Bio-Formats
5.2 release.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

This schema uses the new namespace:

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2016-06/

All the schema files have been unified into a single ome.xsd file located at
this namespace. The version number of this schema file is 1.

Overview of changes
-------------------

- This release will be implemented in Bio-Formats 5.2 and OMERO 5.3.
- This release introduces the concept of Folders, a new Model Object which may
  contain Images, ROIs and other Folders, and which has a strict tree
  hierarchy.


Details
^^^^^^^

- The model element ``Folder`` was added. A Folder specifies a possibly
  heterogeneous collection of data and may contain other Folders, Images and
  ROIs. Data may be in multiple Folders but a Folder may not be in more than
  one other Folder, giving a strict tree hierarchy.
- The ROI properties ``ROI.Namespace``, ``Shape.Linecap`` and
  ``Shape.Visible`` have been dropped.
- The (Poly)Line Markers ``Circle`` and ``Square`` have been dropped.

The following are simplifications for code generation purposes only and have
no functional effects:

- The model element ``LightSource`` has become an abstract class, meaning it
  is now a complexType in the .xsd.
- The model element ``Shape`` has become an abstract class, meaning it
  is now a complexType in the .xsd.
- The MapPairs model element has been removed and the Map model element has
  been made a complexType.
- xsd:appinfo has been extended to provide more detail for enumeration code
  generation, in particular for units.
