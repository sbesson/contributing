Changes For January 2015
========================


The list of the key changes for the January 2015 major release of the
ome-xml data model. This schema release will tie in with the Bio-Formats
5.1 release.

The new major release of the schema has a new namespace and all version
numbers are reset to 1. As a major release, any file that validated
correctly using the last major release will probably not validate
correctly using this new release. Some files that failed to validate
before will now be valid. It is important to update any file readers and
writers to understand the changes.

The version number of all schema files is now 1.

This schema uses the new namespace:

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/[NameSpaceTitle]/2015-01/

For the OME schema

::

    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2015-01/

and the schema file is located at

Overview of changes
-------------------

- This release is preparation for the release of Bio-Formats 5.1 and OMERO
  5.1.
- This version sees the introduction of a major new system of specifying units
  for the values stored as lengths, times, pressures, angles, temperatures,
  electric potentials (voltages), powers and frequencies.
- The annotation points have been greatly expanded and some rationalised.
  Objects in the model are now directly annotatable or are in a 1 to 1
  relationship with an object that is.


BinaryFile
^^^^^^^^^^

- There are no significant changes to this component.

OME
^^^

- Expanded documentation for ``AcquisitionDate`` describing supported
  precision.
- Addition of Annotation points (``AnnotationRef``) to:
    | ``Instrument``
    | ``Objective``
    | ``Detector``
    | ``Filter``
    | ``Dichroic``
    | ``LightPath``
    | ``LightSource``
- Additional attributes to store:
    | ``Pixels: PhysicalSizeXUnit``
    | ``Pixels: PhysicalSizeYUnit``
    | ``Pixels: PhysicalSizeZUnit``
    | ``Pixels: TimeIncrementUnit``
    | ``Plane: DeltaTUnit``
    | ``Plane: ExposureTimeUnit``
    | ``Plane: PositionXUnit``
    | ``Plane: PositionYUnit``
    | ``Plane: PositionZUnit``
    | ``Channel: PinholeSizeUnit``
    | ``Channel: ExcitationWavelengthUnit``
    | ``Channel: EmissionWavelengthUnit``
    | ``StageLabel: XUnit``
    | ``StageLabel: YUnit``
    | ``StageLabel: YUnit``
    | ``ImagingEnvironment: TemperatureUnit``
    | ``ImagingEnvironment: AirPressureUnit``
    | ``Objective: WorkingDistanceUnit``
    | ``Detector: VoltageUnit``
    | ``Filter: CutInUnit``
    | ``Filter: CutOutUnit``
    | ``Filter: CutInToleranceUnit``
    | ``Filter: CutOutToleranceUnit``
    | ``LightSource: PowerUnit``
    | ``Laser: WavelengthUnit``
    | ``Laser: RepetitionRateUnit``
    | ``LightSourceSettings: WavelengthUnit``
    | ``DetectorSettings: VoltageUnit``
    | ``DetectorSettings: ReadOutRateUnit``
- Removal of Annotation points from:
    | ``Pixels: AnnotationRef``
- Changed to float from int:
    | ``Channel: ExcitationWavelength``
    | ``Channel: EmissionWavelength``
    | ``Filter: CutIn``
    | ``Filter: CutOut``
    | ``Filter: CutInTolerance``
    | ``Filter: CutOutTolerance``
    | ``Laser: Wavelength``
    | ``LightSourceSettings: Wavelength``
- Adding a general ``Map`` to ``ImagingEnvironment`` to store key/value pairs
- Adding new core type ``NonNegativeFloat``
- Adding new core element ``Map`` and associated complex type ``MapPairs``.
  This in turn contains a collection of ``M`` elements that store a mapped
  value, each with its associated ``K`` key attribute.
- Define new enumerations with the permitted values for:
    | ``UnitsLength``
    | ``UnitsTime``
    | ``UnitsPressure``
    | ``UnitsAngle``
    | ``UnitsTemperature``
    | ``UnitsElectricPotential``
    | ``UnitsPower``
    | ``UnitsFrequency``
- Adding new ``GenericExcitationSource`` to light source types. This using a
  ``Map`` of key/value pairs to store metadata for a light source that cannot
  be expressed as one of the other types.

OMERO
^^^^^

:file:`OMERO.xsd` is not included in this release.

ROI
^^^

- Addition of Annotation points to:
    ``Shape: AnnotationRef``
- Additional attributes to store:
    ``ROI: StrokeWidthUnit``
    ``ROI: FontSizeUnit``

SA
^^

- A new ``MapAnnotation`` type has been added. This makes use of the new
  ``Map`` element from ``ome.xsd`` to store a collection of key/value pairs.

SPW
^^^

- Additional attributes to store:
    ``WellOriginXUnit``
    ``WellOriginYUnit``
    ``PositionXUnit``
    ``PositionYUnit``
- Removal of Annotation points from:
    ``WellSample: AnnotationRef``
