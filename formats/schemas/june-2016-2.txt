Changes for June 2016 release 2
===============================


List of the key changes made for the minor release updating the June 2016
ome-xml data model. These changes were introduced with the release of
Bio-Formats 5.2.3 in October 2016.

The new minor release of the schema has the same namespace (2016-06) and a new
version number. As a minor release, any file that validated correctly
using the last major release will also validate correctly using this new
release. Some files that failed to validate before will now be valid. It
is important to update any file readers to understand the changes.

-  The version number of the :file:`ome.xsd` schema is now 2.
