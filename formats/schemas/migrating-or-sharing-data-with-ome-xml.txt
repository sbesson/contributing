Migrating or Sharing Data with OME-XML
======================================




Data saved in an OME-XML File is easily read by any software capable of
reading and interpreting OME-XML. OME software tools can export and
import OME-XML Files, but any OME-XML-aware software can be used.

In the figure below, microscope image data is imported into My OME
Database (more accurately, an instance of OME managing image data at one
location). After a set of analyses is performed, this data is exported
in its entirety (i.e., including binary image data, image metadata, and
the associated analytic results) and then passed to a collaborator's OME
database ("Your OME Database"). This strategy packages analytic data
together with the image data to ensure none of the critical
interpretative information is lost.
