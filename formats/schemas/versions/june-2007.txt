Changes For June 2007
=====================




List of the key changes made for the June 2007 release of the ome-xml
data model.

While this may not be a complete list of changes in details, it should
cover all the categories of changes applied to the files. Some changes
affect the structure of the data model, some only the names used for
concepts, and others only the xsd files themselves.

Copyright changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The copyright of the files has been extended to recognize the
contribution of the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

Minimum Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A minimum specification for a valid OME-XML file has been defined.
Further information, including samples, is available at `Minimum
Specification </site/support/file-formats/schemas/specifications/minimum-specification>`_.

Version
~~~~~~~

The way version information is recorded in the XSD files has been
changed to adhere to best practise. For further information see `Version
Information <version-information>`_.

ChannelInfo renamed and extended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This has been renamed to LogicalChannel. It also now has references to
secondary filters for emission and excitation. IlluminationType can now
be NonLinear and Mode now has the catch all type Other. Settings have
been added for PockelCell lasers.

Detector extended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An attribute Zoom has been added for use with confocals. Also updated is
the Type, it can now handle EM-CCD, APD, and CMOS detectors. The EM-CCD
detector type meant that an additional attribute was needed called
AmplificationGain.

DetectorRef extended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A reference to a detector now has the following addition attributes: a
Voltage, a ReadOutRate which is speed at which the detector can count
the pixels, and a Binning setting where detector pixels are combined to
form a larger pixels set.

Laser extended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lasers can now be set as being PockelCell. A RepetitionRate has been
added. The FrequencyDoubled flag has been replaced by the
FrequencyMultiplication setting which, as an integer, can support more
systems. Laser now allows any other LightSource to be used as the Pump.
AuxLightSource and AuxLightSourceRef have been removed as they have been
superseded.

Objective extended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This now has attributes that record the LensNA, WorkingDistance,
ImmersionType, NomimalMagnification (e.g. x60),
CalibratedMagnification(e.g. x60.034), and Correction. The Correction
attribute records the coating applied to the lens. Possible Correction
types are UV, PlanApo, PlanFluor, SuperFluor, and VioletCorrected.
Magnification has been removed as it has been superseded.

ObjectiveRef renamed and extended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ObjectiveRef is now called ObjectiveSettingsRef. CorrectionCollar,
Medium, and RefractiveIndex have been added as attributes.

Pixels extended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pixels can now contain either BinData or TiffData elements to store the
pixel data. It now also can contain Plane elements. Attributes have been
added to hold PhysicalSizeX, PhysicalSizeY, PhysicalSizeZ,
TimeIncrement, WaveStart, and WaveIncrement. These use to be attached to
Image.

Filter and Filter Sets rewritten
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous filter model has been replaced. For further information see
`FilterAndFilterSet
v2007-06 </site/support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml/filter-and-filterset/filter-and-filterset-2007-06>`_.

Images contracted and expanded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make "DefaultPixels" field required in Image - done Image can now
contain the following new elements: PlateRef, AcquiredPixelsRef, ROI,
and MicrobeamManipulation. The attribute DefaultPixels is now required.
The attributes PhysicalSizeX, PhysicalSizeY, PhysicalSizeZ,
TimeIncrement, WaveStart, and WaveIncrement have been moved to Pixels.

Features renamed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout the files Feature and Features have become Region and
Regions. This allows the naming to be consistent with the region of
interest model.

Screening Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new file SPW.xsd has been added to hold the Screen/Plate/Well model.
With its creation Plate and Screen that were in OME.XSD have been moved
and re-written. For further information see `Screen Plate Well
v2007-06 </site/support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml/screen-plate-well/screen-plate-well-2007-06>`_.

OME-Tiff extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The changes necessary to support the OME-Tiff format have been applied -
This was the addition of the TiffData element to Pixels as an option to
the BinData element.

Internal IDs and LSID changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ID types used throughout the OME-XML model are designed to support
identifiers in two forms, full LSID format and internal only format. The
formats of these are now enforced in an improved way using new regular
expressions. For further information see
`LSID </site/support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml/id-and-lsid>`_

The Image/Experiment Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This has been modified.

Naming conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The naming convention used for attribute, element and enumeration names,
already partly implemented was written down and existing names corrected
as necessary.

for enumerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enumerations names will normally use UpperCamelCase, and contain letters
& numbers and the dash. No spaces and no other punctuation. The '-' is
the only permitted punctuation character (so 'e-' is allowed). Only
abbreviations in common use in the field should be used.

for attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Attributes names will use UpperCamelCase, letters only, no punctuation.
Where practical whole words will be used rather then abbreviations.

for elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Elements names will use UpperCamelCase, letters only, no punctuation.
Where practical whole words will be used rather then abbreviations.
Element names will normally be unique across all the OME files and where
an element name is reused is will be for a specific reason that is
outline in an annotation present in each place the element is defined.

Miscellaneous corrections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some spelling mistakes have been corrected. There have been minor
changed to the file layouts.

Plane
~~~~~

This has been modified and now contains some of the structures that were
in Image.

    Notes: in the XSD files the element and attribute names use
    CamelCase and PascalCase. As these are also interpreted by
    WikiFormatting this may result in links to seeming missing pages.
    These will be display as follows: DummyElememtName
