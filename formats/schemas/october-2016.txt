Changes for October 2016
========================


List of the key changes made for the October 2016 minor release of the
ome-xml data model.

The new minor release of the schema has the same namespace (2016-06) and a new
version number. As a minor release, any file that validated correctly
using the last major release will also validate correctly using this new
release. Some files that failed to validate before will now be valid. It
is important to update any file readers to understand the changes. File
writers will not necessarily need corrected.

-  The version number of the :file:`ome.xsd` schema is now 2.
