The OME-XML Format
==================




Features and applications of the OME-XML file format

The OME-XML File serves as a convenient file format for data migration
from one site or user to another. The OME-XML File captures all image
acquisition and experimental metadata along with the binary image data
and packages it into an easily readable package. Our
`paper <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_ describing the design
and implementation of the OME-XML File appeared in Genome Biology.

    OME-XML files can be read by potentially any software package - you
    do not need OME image management software to use OME-XML.

Some specific features of the OME-XML File Format:

-  OME-XML files may contain one or more sets of 5-D Pixels, for example
   raw data from a microscope, the deconvolved data, and a volume
   rendered view.
-  OME-XML files contain all the metadata associated with an image,
   including the experimental (cells, genes, etc.) and acquisition
   (microscope light sources, fluors, filters, detectors, etc.)
   metadata.
-  OME-XML Image pixels may be stored compressed (or not) directly in
   XML with base64 encoding. Compression of the pixels and the metadata
   is supported through widely-available patent-free compression schemes
   (gzip and bzip2). OME-XML Images are addressable by plane.
-  OME-XML files have a built-in mechanism for supporting arbitrary
   user-defined data that can be used globally or attached to Images,
   Features (objects inside Images), and Datasets. Mechanisms for
   OME-compliant systems to populate databases with these user-defined
   fields is part of the specification. See the Semantic Type
   Definitions XML Schema, documentation and an example document that
   defines the core OME Semantic Types.

The OME-XML Schema and use are documented
`here <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/>`_.

Ongoing Development
-------------------

The ongoing development of the OME-XML data model can be tracked on
`http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_.

Users can also add work tickets to the system detailing any changes they
feel should be made.

Commercial Support for OME-XML
------------------------------

Bitplane AG and EAMNET have proposed the use of the OME-XML File as an
image data migration standard. A C++ class that reads OME-XML has been
posted by Peter Majer and Marius Messerli of Bitplane AG on the EAMNET
site. `Details <http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/downloads.html>`_ Thanks
to Peter and Marius for this.

Applied Precision, LLC has released an image visualisation tool that
reads and writes OME-XML.
`Details <http://www.api.com/softworx-explorer.asp>`_

Scientific Volume Imaging has included support for the OME-XML file
format in there Huygens Software, a collection of Fluorescence
Microscope image processing packages. The packages are available for
many software platforms.
`Details <http://support.svi.nl/wiki/HuygensSoftware>`_

Improvision joins the ever-increasing list of commercial solution
providers that supports OME-TIFF. Support is available from the release
of Version 4.2.
