=============================

A major goal of the OME project is the provision of common
specifications for light microscopy file formats. Most light microscope
data is collected using proprietary software. In general, users must
convert files between formats to access different processing or display
functionality. Migration between different formats is laborious, but
most importantly often results in loss of critical image metadata.

The OME consortium has three projects providing tools for standardised
file formats: OME-XML, OME-TIFF, and Bio-Formats. The definition,
development, and maintenance of these tools are the result of close
collaboration between all academic and commercial partners in the OME
Consortium.

OME-XML Compliance
------------------

View `our
proposal </site/support/file-formats/schemas/specifications/compliant-file-specification>`_
for a specification, to describe as completely as possible a specific
imaging experiment.
 Or read our published paper `Linkert et al (2010), J. Cell Biol.
189(5):777-782 <http://jcb.rupress.org/content/189/5/777>`_

What is OME-TIFF
----------------

OME-TIFF is a practical, high performance interchange format that
encodes the metadata using the OME-XML data model. Check out the
`OME-TIFF overview </site/support/file-formats/ome-tiff>`_.

Developer Resources
-------------------

Developing software to work with OME-XML files? Find links to more
technical information on the
`Developer </site/support/file-formats/working-with-ome-xml>`_ page.

Latest OME-XML/OME-TIFF
-----------------------

Want to find the latest **June 2012 Schema** specification for OME-XML
or OME-TIFF? Check the `schema
location <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/>`_ page that always has
links to the latest version and latest auto-generated documentation.

OME-XML Versions
----------------

Discover how the OME-XML and OME-TIFF `version
system </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/version-information>`_
works.

Have a file and need to know the version? - use the `online
validator <http://validator.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_.

How to Cite OME's Work
----------------------

If you have used OME-XML, OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats or OMERO in your work
find the `correct citations </site/community/citing-ome>`_ to use.

Companies supporting OME-XML or OME-TIFF
----------------------------------------

We have received support from several companies who are writing files
using our file formats, for details see our full list of
