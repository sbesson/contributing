A major goal of the OME project is the provision of common
specifications for light microscopy file formats. Most light microscope
data is collected using proprietary software. In general, users must
convert files between formats to access different processing or display
functionality. Migration between different formats is laborious, but
most importantly often results in loss of critical image metadata.

The OME consortium has three projects providing tools for standardised
file formats: OME-XML, OME-TIFF, and Bio-Formats. The definition,
development, and maintenance of these tools are the result of close
collaboration between all academic and commercial partners in the OME
Consortium.

The OME Data Model
==================

The OME Model is a specification for storing data on biological imaging.
The model includes image parameters, such as XYZ dimensions, pixels type
etc. as well as extensive metadata on image acquisition, annotation,
regions of interest (ROIs) etc. This common specification is essential
for exchange of image data between different software packages.

OME-TIFF
--------

The OME Data Model is implemented as the OME-TIFF file format. OME-TIFF
is a multi-plane tiff file that contains OME metadata in the header, in
the form of OME-XML. This allows the pixels to be read with any 
TIFF-compatible program and the metadata to be extracted with any OME-aware 
application.

See the :doc:`OME-TIFF overview <ome-tiff/index>`.

OME-XML
-------

The OME-XML File serves as a convenient file format for data migration
from one site or user to another. The OME-XML file captures all image
acquisition and experimental metadata along with the binary image data
and packages it into an easily readable package. Our
`paper <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_ describing the design
and implementation of the OME-XML File appeared in Genome Biology.

See :doc:`the-ome-xml-file` for further details.

OME-XML Java Library
--------------------

The OME-XML Java library is a collection of Java packages for
manipulating OME-XML metadata structures which you can download to work with 
yourself.

See :doc:`ome-xml-java-library`.

OME-XML Compliance
------------------

View 
:doc:`our proposal <schemas/specifications/compliant-file>`
for a specification, to describe as completely as possible a specific
imaging experiment.

Or read our published paper 
`Linkert et al (2010), J. Cell Biol. 189(5):777-782 <http://jcb.rupress.org/content/189/5/777>`_

:doc:`Specifications for HCS <schemas/specifications/compliant-hcs>` 
and a :doc:`minimum specification <schemas/specifications/minimum>` are also 
available.

Developer Resources
===================

Developing software to work with OME-XML files? Find links to more
technical information on the
:doc:`Developer information page <working-with-ome-xml/index>`.

Latest OME-XML/OME-TIFF
-----------------------

Want to find the latest **June 2012 Schema** specification for OME-XML
or OME-TIFF? Check the 
`schema location <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/>`_ 
page that always has
links to the latest version and latest auto-generated documentation.

OME-XML Versions
----------------

Discover how the OME-XML and OME-TIFF 
`version system </site/support/file-formats/schemas/versions/version-information>`_
works.

Have a file and need to know the version? - use the 
`online validator <http://validator.openmicroscopy.org.uk/>`_.

How to Cite OME's Work
----------------------

If you have used OME-XML, OME-TIFF, Bio-Formats or OMERO in your work
find the :about_plone:`correct citations <licensing-attribution/citing-ome>` 
to use.


Companies supporting OME-XML or OME-TIFF
========================================

We have received support from several companies who are writing files
using our file formats, for details see our full list of
:about_plone:`Partners <partners>`.
