Sample Image Files
==================

Collection of sample OME-XML and OME-TIFF files.

    Sample OME-XML and OME-TIFF files can be found here:
    `Samples </Schemas/Samples/>`_

Structure of the samples
------------------------

Each schema version's samples are in a folder named after the schema's
date

e.g. folder ``2012-06`` has samples using schema version
`http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2012-06 <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/OME/2012-06>`_

There are two sets of samples that were designed to be small enough to
examine in details:

-  ``18x24y*-text*`` are 18 be 24 pixel images, with black and white
   text on each plane giving its time, z-depth and channel. e.g. C1 Z1
   T1
-  ``6x4y*-swatch`` are 6 by 4 pixel images, that have a black and white
   pattern in the first 2 x-columns, followed by a grey scale pattern in
   the next 4 columns

The File names contain:
``x`` size, ``y`` size, ``z`` depth, ``t`` timepoints, ``c`` channels,
and ``b`` bitdepth

-  A file ending in ``.ome`` is the OME-XML version
-  A file ending in ``.ome.tiff`` is the OME-TIFF version
   that matches the OME-XML version

Detail file list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a list of all the example for the 2010-06 Schema Version. While
most are available in all the schema versions some files are only
available in the later versions.

 ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-1s1p4w2ws.ome``
    \- file contains 11 images. The file shows how these images can be
    attached to wells within a plate.

 ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-2s2p4w2ws.ome``
    \- file contains 22 images. The file shows how two plates and two
    screens can be linked together.

 ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-instrument.ome``
    \- most of the other examples contain no instrument data. This file
    has a single image with an instrument using lights sources,
    detectors, objectives and filters.

 ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-tagged.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has two tags and a tagset
    attached to it using annotations.

 ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch-xmlannotation-svg.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has a block of XML data
    attached to it using annotations. The XML data is SVG in this
    example but could be any well formed XML.

 ``6x4y1z1t1c8b-swatch.ome``
    \- file has a single image. This file is the on on which the other
    files are based.

 ``6x4y1z1t3c8b-swatch-ROI.ome``
    \- file has a single image, but that image has 3 channels. There are
    3 ROIs defined, two on only a single channel and one that applies to
    all the channels.

 ``6x4y1z1t3c8b-swatch.ome``
    \- file has a single image, but that image has 3 channels.
    
 ``18x24y1z5t1c8b-text.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
    timepoints.

 ``18x24y1z5t2c8b-text.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
    timepoints. Each of these timepoints has 2 channels to give a total
    of 10 bit planes.

 ``18x24y5z1t1c8b-text.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
    z-sections.

 ``18x24y5z1t2c8b-text.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
    z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 2 channels to give a total
    of 10 bit planes.

 ``18x24y5z5t1c8b-metadata.ome``
    \- file defines a single image. The image is defined as having pixels
    for 5 z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 5 timepoints to give
    a total of 25 bit planes. This is a metadata only file. It only has
    the metadata defining the image not any of the pixel data.

 ``18x24y5z5t1c8b-text.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
    z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 5 timepoints to give a
    total of 25 bit planes.

 ``18x24y5z5t2c8b-text.ome``
    \- file has a single image. The image has pixels stored for 5
    z-sections. Each of these z-sections has 5 timepoints. Each of these
    timepoints has 2 channels to give a total of 50 bit planes.
