File Format Specifications
--------------------------

OME-XML
~~~~~~~

OME partners at Dundee develop and maintain the OME-XML schemas that
represent the data model. The XML namespaces for the current schemas are
located on this site. This also where the XSD files are available to
download from.

`http://www.openmicroscopy.org/Schemas/ </Schemas/>`_

    Note: any schemas and documentation below
    http://www.openmicroscopy.org/XMLschemas/ is preserved for legacy
    support only. This includes the 2003FC schema used by the original
    OME server.

OME-TIFF
~~~~~~~~

OME partners at LOCI have developed a variant of the OME-XML File
specifically designed for data acquisition and storage. This format,
called OME-TIFF, uses OME-XML in the standard TIFF header and stores
binary image data in a multi-page TIFF file.

Sample Image Files
------------------

These files along with an explination of there structure is available on
the `sample image files <./sample-files>`_ page.

XSLT Transform Samples
----------------------

There are two transforms available that convert between the hierarchical
pre-July 2007 OME schema and a flat CA only representation of that
schema. These are used as part of the import process by the OME Server
and are no longer being maintained.
