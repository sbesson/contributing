The OME-TIFF File
=================




OME partners at LOCI have developed a variant of the OME-XML File
specifically designed for data acquisition and storage. This format,
called OME-TIFF, uses OME-XML in the standard TIFF header and stores
binary image data in a multi-page TIFF file.

`LOCI </site/about/development-teams/kevin>`_ maintains the OME-TIFF
documentation and specification.

In the OME-XML File binary image data is stored as compressed base64.
This is convenient for data migration, but has some drawbacks:

-  Decoding base64-encoded image planes is computationally expensive.
-  There is no facility to split a dataset among multiple files on disk.

OME-TIFF is designed to solve these problems. OME-TIFF means that:

-  Image planes are stored within one multi-page TIFF file, or across
   multiple TIFF files. Any image organization is feasible.
-  A complete OME-XML metadata block describing the image is embedded in
   each TIFF file's header. Thus, even if some of the TIFF files in a
   5-dimensional image are misplaced, the metadata remains intact.
-  The OME-XML metadata block in an OME-TIFF file may contain anything a
   standard OME-XML file can, including multiple OME images with
   multiple sets of pixels.
-  The only conceptual difference between OME-XML and OME-TIFF is that
   instead of encoding pixels as base64 chunks within the XML like
   OME-XML does, OME-TIFF uses the standard TIFF mechanism for storing
   one or more image planes in each of the constituent file(s).
-  Storing image data in TIFF is a de facto standard, and essentially
   all image handling software can read TIFF-based formats, thus
   adoption and integration of OME-TIFF is straightforward.
