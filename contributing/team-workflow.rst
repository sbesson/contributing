Team workflow summary
=====================

Development management
----------------------

The OME team uses a Kanban-based approach to manage development work. New
features, or bug fixes which require significant amounts of work, are
identified as priorities, listed in the 'Priorities List' board on
Trello and then assigned to a target release. As the particular release
becomes imminent, cards assigned to it are moved to a dedicated release board
to allow all the current work to be tracked in one place. 'Epic' bodies of
work may be managed via topic-based boards.

Developers should focus on the tasks identified as priorities for the next
point release or longer-term work towards the next major version based on the
outcome of team meetings. Constant communication is vital to ensure everyone
is working together to the same goals.

Public-facing workflow
----------------------

To follow the development process from outside the project, you can view the
milestones on the :milestone:`Trac Roadmap page <>` and Trac tickets for
:report:`bugs <8>` and/or follow our new
`public Trello OME organization <https://trello.com/ome>`_. Trello is now used
for higher level planning and will be of most interest to those concerned with
new features and functionality (Trac is still used for individual bug
tracking). The 'Getting Started' board provides full instructions and an index
of current boards, allowing you to browse upcoming work for the next releases
and topic-based 'epic' work plans.

You can sign up for a free Trello account to add comments and you need to be
added to the organization (by commenting on the 'Add me, please' card) to gain
extra permissions e.g. to vote on or add cards.
