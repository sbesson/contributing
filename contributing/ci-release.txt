	:jenkinsjob:`OME-5.0-release-trigger`

		This job triggers the release jobs. Prior to running it, its variables
		need to be properly configured:

		- :envvar:`RELEASE` is the release number for OMERO and Bio-Formats.
		- :envvar:`ANNOUNCEMENT_URL` is the URL of the forum release
		  announcement and should be set to the value of the URL of the
		  private post until it becomes public.
		- :envvar:`MILESTONE` is the name of the Trac milestone which the
		  download pages should be linked to.
