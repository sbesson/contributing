Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For all jobs building documentation using Sphinx, the HTML documentation theme
hosted at https://github.com/openmicroscopy/sphinx_theme repository is copied
to the relevant :file:`themes/` folder. The following environment variables
are then used:

- the Sphinx building options, :envvar:`SPHINXOPTS`, is set to
  ``-W -D html_theme=sphinx_theme``

- the release number of the documentation is set by :envvar:`OMERO_RELEASE`,
  :envvar:`BF_RELEASE` or by the relevant POM

- the source code links use :envvar:`SOURCE_USER` and :envvar:`SOURCE_BRANCH`

- for the Bio-Formats and OMERO sets of documentation, the name of the
  Jenkins job is set by :envvar:`JENKINS_JOB`.

All live documentation folders are copied over SSH to
necromancer.openmicroscopy.org.uk under the
:file:`/var/www/www.openmicroscopy.org/sphinx-docs` directory using the
:program:`scc deploy` command. The :jenkinsjob:`OME-docs-deployment-setup` job
is used to initialize new deployment folders.

OME Files
^^^^^^^^^

This bundle of Sphinx documentation has two components: OME Files C++
documentation is located in the ome-files-cpp repository; OME CMake
Super-Build documentation is located in the ome-cmake-superbuild repository.
Both are currently built from the master branches despite the build names.

.. glossary::

     :jenkinsjob:`OME-FILES-CPP-DEV-release-bundle-docs`

	    This job is used to publish the master branches of the OME Files C++
	    and OME CMake Super-Build Sphinx documentation as a single bundle

	    #. |buildFilesSB|
	    #. |deploy-doc| http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-files-cpp/

The merge and latest builds for this documentation set are detailed on the
:doc:`ci-ome-files` page. The staging location for reviewing documentation PRs
opened against either of these repositories is
https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/ome-files-cpp-staging/

Note that because of the bundle nature of these builds, they does not use the
standard Sphinx configuration described above nor report broken links parsed
through the warnings plugin as below.

.. _linkcheck_parser:

Linkcheck output parser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Warnings Plugin: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Plugin

The :file:`output.txt` file generated by Sphinx ``linkcheck`` builder is
parsed using the `Warnings Plugin`_. Depending on the nature of the links,
warnings are generated as described in the following table:

====== ================ ========
Type   Error code		Priority
====== ================ ========
local					High
broken HTTP Error 404	Normal
broken Anchor not found Normal
broken HTTP Error 403	Low
====== ================ ========

The build is marked as FAILED or UNSTABLE if the number of warnings of a given
category exceeds a threshold. The table below lists the thresholds used for
all the documentation builds:

======== ====== ========
Priority FAILED UNSTABLE
======== ====== ========
High	 0
Normal			0
Low				10
======== ====== ========
