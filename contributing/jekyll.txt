Jekyll hosted websites
======================

A number of OME websites are produced using Jekyll, including

- `Blog <http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/>`_
- `Help <http://help.openmicroscopy.org/>`_

These sites can be built and tested by installing a local copy of Jekyll, or
by using the Jenkins jobs and staging sites listed in :doc:`ci-docs`.

The public released pages are hosted
and automatically generated by `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_
with a `custom subdomain
<https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/>`_.


Installing Jekyll
-----------------

Jekyll can be installed as a system application (requires administrator
privileges) or for a single user.

1. Install a recent version of Ruby. Recent versions of OS X and Linux may
   already include a suitable version, however you will require
   administrator privileges to install Jekyll.
   Alternatively on OS X you can use Homebrew, and on Linux either `rbenv
   <https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv>`_ or `RVM <https://rvm.io/>`_::

       brew install ruby20

2. Install Jekyll::

       gem install jekyll


Running Jekyll
--------------

In a terminal enter the local git checkout and run::

    jekyll serve -w -b ''

This will build the web pages and start a local server on
http://localhost:4000/.
Jekyll should automatically rebuild the pages when changes are made to the
source files, and will override any `baseurl` defined in `_config.yml`.
