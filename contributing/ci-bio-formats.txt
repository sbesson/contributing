        :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-DEV-breaking-trigger`

                This job runs the daily Bio-Formats jobs used for reviewing the PRs
                opened against the develop branch of Bio-Formats by running basic unit
                tests, checking for open file handles, and checking for regressions
                across a representative subset of the data repository

                #. Triggers :term:`BIOFORMATS-DEV-breaking-push`
                #. Triggers downstream jobs

                See :jenkinsjob:`the build graph <BIOFORMATS-DEV-breaking-trigger/lastSuccessfulBuild/BuildGraph>`

        :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-DEV-breaking-push`

                This job merges all the breaking PRs opened against develop

                #. |merge| labeled as breaking
                #. Pushes the branch to :bf_scc_branch:`develop/breaking/trigger`

        :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-DEV-breaking-build`

                This job builds the merge artifacts of Bio-Formats

                #. Computes the diff with
                   :bf_scc_branch:`develop/latest/generated_sources` and archives
                   the artifacts

        :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-DEV-breaking-test_images_good`

                This job runs automated tests against the test_images_good subset on

                #. Runs automated tests against :file:`/ome/data_repo/from_skyking/`

        :jenkinsjob:`BIOFORMATS-DEV-breaking-repository-subset`

                This job runs automated tests against a subset of the data repository

                #. |merge| labeled as breaking
                #. Runs automated tests against a subset of format directories under
                   :file:`/ome/data_repo/from_skyking/`. The list of directories to
                   test by setting a space-separated list of formats for the
                   ``DEFAULT_FORMAT_LIST`` variable.
