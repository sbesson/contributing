Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^

OME uses semantic versioning as defined in http://semver.org. Each version
number is identified as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where MAJOR is the major version
number, MINOR the minor version number and PATCH the patch version number.
Additional pre-release labels are added as extensions of this version number,
e.g. 4.4.0-rc1 or 5.0.0-beta1.

.. glossary::

	Major release

		An increment of the MAJOR version or the MINOR version is typically
		considered as a major release in OME, e.g. 4.4.0 or 5.0.0.

	Point release (patch release)

		An increment of the PATCH version is called a point (or patch) release
		in OME, e.g. 4.4.9.

Development branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the OME code is split between four repositories: openmicroscopy.git_,
bioformats.git_, scripts.git_, ome-documentation.git_. For each repository,
two development branches are maintained simultaneously:

* The "dev_4_4" branch contains work on the 4.4.x series.

* The "dev_5_0" branch contains work on the 5.0.x series.

* The "develop" branch contains work on the 5.1.x series.

It is possible to have a point release immediately, while still working on
more major releases by ensuring that (nearly) all commits that are applied to
dev_4_4 are applied to develop in order to prevent regressions.

Labels
^^^^^^

Labels are applied to PRs on GitHub under the “Issues” tab of each repository.

The 4.4.x series consists of PRs labelled with “dev_4_4”, which
is the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

The 5.0.x series consists of PRs labelled with “dev_5_0”, which is also
the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

The 5.1.x series consists of PRs labelled with “develop”, which is also
the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

Three labels are used in the PR reviewing process: “include”, “exclude”, and
"on hold". The “include” label allows you to include a PR opened by a
non-member of the OME organization in the merge builds for review. The
“exclude” label allows you to exclude a PR opened by any user from the merge
builds. The "on hold" label allows you to signal that a PR should not be
reviewed or merged, even though it is not excluded.
