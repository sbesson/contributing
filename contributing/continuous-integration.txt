Definitions

Versioning
^^^^^^^^^^

OME uses semantic versioning as defined in http://semver.org. Each version
number is identified as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where MAJOR is the major version
number, MINOR the minor version number and PATCH the patch version number.
Additional pre-release labels are added as extensions of this version number,
e.g. 4.4.0-RC1 or 5.0.0-beta1.

.. glossary::

	Major release

		An increment of the MAJOR version or the MINOR version is typically
		considered as a major release in OME, e.g. 4.4.0 or 5.0.0.

	Point release (patch release)

		An increment of the PATCH version is called a point (or patch) release
		in OME, e.g. 4.4.9.

Development branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the OME code is split between four repositories: openmicroscopy.git_,
bioformats.git_, scripts.git_, ome-documentation.git_. For each repository,
two development branches are maintained simultaneously:

* The "|stable_branch|" branch ("stable" branch) contains work on the stable
  release series (|stable_version|.x) and will only be released as a patch release.

* The "dev_5_0" branch contains work on the next major release.

It is possible to have a point release immediately, while still working on
more major releases by ensuring that (nearly) all commits that are applied to
|stable_branch| are applied to develop in order to prevent regressions.

Labels
^^^^^^

Labels are applied to PRs on GitHub under the “Issues” tab of each repository.

The next point release consists of PRs labelled with “|stable_branch|”, which is
the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

The next major release consists of PRs labelled with “develop”, which is also
the name of the branch which they will be merged into.

Three labels are used in the PR reviewing process: “include”, “exclude”, and
"on hold". The “include” label allows you to include a PR opened by a
non-member of the OME organization in the merge builds for review. The
“exclude” label allows you to exclude a PR opened by any user from the merge
builds. The "on hold" label allows you to signal that a PR should not be
reviewed or merged, even though it is not excluded.


..  |merge| replace:: Merges PRs using :ref:`scc merge`
..  |buildOMERO| replace:: Builds the OMERO.server and the clients using :source:`OMERO.sh <docs/hudson/OMERO.sh>`
..  |archiveOMEROartifacts| replace:: Archives the build artifacts
..  |deployOMERO| replace:: Deploys the server under :file:`~/OMERO-CURRENT` on
..  |promoteOMERO| replace:: copies the artifacts to necromancer

..  |updatesubmodules| replace:: Updates submodules using ``scc update-submodules``

Continuous integration server
-----------------------------

The OME project uses `Jenkins <http://jenkins-ci.org>`_ as a continuous
integration server. To access the OME Jenkins server, bring up a web
browser and go to http://hudson.openmicroscopy.org.uk.

The following sections summarize the main continuous integration jobs used for
the development of OMERO, Bio-Formats and the OME documentation sets. Note
this is not an exhaustive list of all jobs in the project. To know more about
a particular job, click on the :guilabel:`Configure` button on the left-side
panel of the job window.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For all jobs building documentation using Sphinx, the HTML documentation theme
hosted at https://github.com/openmicroscopy/sphinx_theme repository is copied
to the relevant :file:`themes/` folder. The following environment variables
are then used:

- the Sphinx building options, :envvar:`SPHINXOPTS`, is set to
  ``-W -D html_theme=sphinx_theme``,

- the release number of the documentation is set by :envvar:`OMERO_RELEASE`,
  :envvar:`BF_RELEASE` or :envvar:`FORMATS_RELEASE`,

- the source code links use :envvar:`SOURCE_USER` and :envvar:`SOURCE_BRANCH`,

- for the Bio-Formats and OMERO sets of documentation, the name of the
  Jenkins job is set by :envvar:`JENKINS_JOB`.

Linkcheck output parser
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _Warnings Plugin: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Plugin

The :file:`output.txt` file generated by Sphinx ``linkcheck`` builder is
parsed using the `Warnings Plugin`_. Depending on the nature of the links,
warnings are generated as described in the following table:

====== ================ ========
Type   Error code       Priority
====== ================ ========
local                   High
broken HTTP Error 404   Normal
broken Anchor not found Normal
broken HTTP Error 403   Low
====== ================ ========

The build is marked as FAILED or UNSTABLE if the number of warnings of a given
category exceeds a threshold. The table below lists the thresholds used for
all the documentation builds:

======== ====== ========
Priority FAILED UNSTABLE
======== ====== ========
High     0
Normal          0
Low             10
======== ====== ========
