Team workflow summary
=====================

Development management
----------------------

The OME team uses a Kanban-based approach to manage development work. New
features, or bug fixes which require significant amounts of work, are
identified as priorities and then listed in the 'Upcoming Features' board on
Trello. They then move through 'scoping' to 'implementing' to 'ready for QA'
as work on them is progressed. This board acts to give an overview of the
development work.

The individual components of work required to complete each feature or fix are
managed on further boards, for example the UX board for client UI work. Each
developer has a primary board where their main effort is focused and comments
on the relevant cards to update their colleagues on progress. Cards also
progress through 'to do', 'in progress' and 'done' equivalent lists, the exact
titling of which vary from board to board but should be self-explanatory.
Developers should focus on the tasks identified as priorities for the next
point release or longer term work towards the next major version based on the
outcome of team meetings. Constant communication is vital to ensure everyone
is working together to the same goals.

Public-facing workflow
----------------------

Currently, the Trello boards are only viewable to members of the
openmicroscopy organisation. To follow the development process from outside
the project, you can view the milestones on the
:milestone:`Trac Roadmap page <>` and Trac tickets for :report:`bugs <8>`.
Internally reported issues are increasingly being managed on Trello cards
rather than Trac tickets so it is likely that at least one board will be made
public in the future. The workflow is still in transition currently as we work
on ways to integrate Trello with our other tools more effectively.
