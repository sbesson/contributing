Development tools: maintenance
==============================

Most of the development tools used internally by the OME project are Python 
based and hosted on the :pypi:`Python Package Index <>`. Their source code is
on GitHub.

Maintainer pre-requisites
-------------------------

To be able to maintain a Python development tool, a developer must:

- have a GitHub account and have push rights to the GitHub source code 
  repository
- have a PyPI account and be registered as a maintainer of the PyPI repository
- have a valid PGP key for signing the tags

For uploading your package to PyPI, you will also need to create a 
:file:`~/.pypirc` file.

Release process
---------------

The first operation to perform while releasing a project is to create a signed
tag locally::

   $ cd <project>
   $ scc tag-release -s x.y.z

The last command will create a tag with the default `v` prefix, i.e. `vx.y.z`.
The distribution can then be created and uploaded to PyPI via::

   $ git clean -dfx
   $ python setup.py sdist upload

The upload command should update the PyPI record.

Finally, the signed tag needs to be pushed to the source code repository::

   $ git push origin vx.y.z
