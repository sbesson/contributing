OMERO.clients
=============

OMERO.clients use a common 'gateway' to communicate with an OMERO.server
installation and allow the user to import, display, edit, and manage
server data. The OMERO team has developed a suite of clients, but the
open source nature of the OMERO project also allows developers to create
their own, customized clients.

-  **End users and scientists** interested in using our OMERO client
   software should see the client documentation page located at `Â the
   main OME
   website <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4/getting-started/client-documentation>`_.

-  **Developers** interested in writing custom OMERO clients should See
   `DevelopingOmeroClients </ome/wiki/DevelopingOmeroClients>`_.

Examples for all the `OmeroBlitz </ome/wiki/OmeroBlitz>`_ languages
(`OmeroPy </ome/wiki/OmeroPy>`_, `OmeroJava </ome/wiki/OmeroJava>`_,
`OmeroCpp </ome/wiki/OmeroCpp>`_, and
`OmeroMatlab </ome/wiki/OmeroMatlab>`_) are provided under:

-  `source:ome.git/examples </ome/browser/ome.git/examples>`_

The examples under the ``OmeroClients`` directory are more thoroughly
discussed on the `OmeroClients </ome/wiki/OmeroClients>`_ page. This is
a good starting point for anyone interested in working with the
`OmeroApi </ome/wiki/OmeroApi>`_ or the
`ObjectModel </ome/wiki/ObjectModel>`_.

Examples with Java source code are available under:
`Examples </ome/browser/ome.git/components/insight/TEST/org/openmicroscopy/shoola/examples>`_
