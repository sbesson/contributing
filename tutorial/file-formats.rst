Currently Supported Importer Formats
------------------------------------

OMERO uses the [Bio-Formats library]
(http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats.html) to support over 120
different proprietary file formats. Please note however that we try to
extensively test each file format before we add, so our success depends
on how much test data we have.

As always, contributions of sample data will help to ensure that the
OMERO accurately supports a wide range of formats, and any contributions
you may wish to make are always welcome by contacting us on our forums
`here <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/community/viewforum.php?f=4>`__, or
our user mailing list
`here <http://lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/ome-users/>`__.
